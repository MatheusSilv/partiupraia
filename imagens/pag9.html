	<h1>Marine Biology</h1>
	<h2>The composition software</h2>
	<p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and PH. These elemnts vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.</p>
